## In JavaScript, a string is a data type representing a sequence of characters that may consist of letters, numbers, symbols, words, or sentences. Strings in javascript are primitive data types and immutable, which means they are unchangable.

## A String can represet an object as well as the primitive data type. Javscript automatically converts primitive string to string object so that it's possible to use string methods and access properties even for primitive strings.
